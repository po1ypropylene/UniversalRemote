# Development and maintenance

All three scripts preview their work by default. Python 3 is required; the updater
also uses Git, Go and Xcode for the selected components. Run them from any directory.

```sh
# Preview upstream releases; --latest stays in the current native/SwiftTerm major.
scripts/update-dependencies.py --latest
# Apply pins/checksums and rebuild. Protocol verification is still required.
scripts/update-dependencies.py --latest --apply --build
# Or update just one component to a selected stable release:
scripts/update-dependencies.py --freerdp 3.32.1 --apply --build

# Preview/remove generated builds, dependency caches, logs and synthetic test outputs.
scripts/clean-project.py
scripts/clean-project.py --apply

# Preview a permanent app-data reset; quit the app before applying it.
scripts/clean-user-data.py
scripts/clean-user-data.py --apply
```

The updater writes native commit pins, SwiftTerm's exact requirement and resolved
package lock, WireGuard's Go manifest/checksums, and the third-party version inventory.
It resolves WireGuard's dependency graph without independently upgrading gVisor.
Stable native/SwiftTerm versions are compared numerically by major, minor and patch;
SwiftTerm tags with `v`/`V` prefixes are recognized. Downgrades are rejected.
Pin/manifest resolution failures restore the original tracked file contents;
downloaded caches may remain. Successfully applied pins remain if a subsequent
build fails. Old native outputs and synthetic RDP builds are invalidated when
native pins change. Inspect the diff, review upstream license/NOTICE changes and
refresh the bundled notices in `ThirdParty` as needed, then run the verification
commands in AGENTS.md before relying on new versions. The updater does not install
or upgrade Xcode, CMake, Python, Go, or test-only Paramiko.

Project cleanup removes all of `.build`, `DerivedData` and `build`, including app/compiler outputs, release DMGs, generated test data and ignored untracked logs/Python caches. It preserves `.dependencies`, `Vendor/Native`, tracked source fixtures, `.local-testing` and user Library/Keychain data. Stop builds and fixture servers before cleaning. Rebuild the app with `scripts/build.sh`; dependency downloads and installed libraries survive cleanup. Cleanup rejects tracked generated files and redirected build-directory parents, and never follows symlinks during deletion.

User-data cleanup permanently removes this account's Universal Remote container,
local credential fallback, preferences, cached/saved state and temporary SFTP previews.
This includes saved connections/folders, WireGuard profiles/keys, passwords/imported
private-key copies, server trust, settings and local-folder bookmarks. It deletes only
generic-password Keychain items in `com.peterpo.UniversalRemote.credentials`, without
reading/exporting credentials. Quit the app and tunnel helper, run as your own user
without sudo, and retain any exports you need first. Keychain authorization or macOS
Library protections may block deletion; failures return a nonzero status and can leave
a partial reset. Resolve the reported access issue and retry. Other apps' data,
original imported key/config files, the installed app, repository and protected test
input are preserved. No system privacy permissions are reset.

Maintenance regression checks use disposable files and mocked credential deletion:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s Tests/Maintenance -v`.

## Version and DMG for a release

Edit **[Version.xcconfig](../Version.xcconfig)** at the repository root. It is the single
source for the app's version (`MARKETING_VERSION`, such as `0.1.0`) and build number
(`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, a positive integer). Both Debug and Release in Xcode
read it; do not override these values in the project settings. Increase the build
number for another build of the same version.

To build an app and a DMG for uploading later, run:

```sh
scripts/build-dmg.sh
```

The script builds and verifies the Release app, copies it into a compressed,
read-only DMG alongside an Applications shortcut, mounts the image to verify the
packaged app's signatures/libraries/loader, then ejects it. It writes:

```text
.build/releases/Universal-Remote-<version>-build-<build>-arm64.dmg
.build/releases/Universal-Remote-<version>-build-<build>-arm64.dmg.sha256
```

The filename comes from the built app's version fields. Rebuilding the same
version/build replaces those generated files after verification; earlier versions
remain. Both outputs are ignored by Git. The script does not read test credentials,
connect to servers, make commits/tags, upload files or create GitHub releases.
Upload the DMG as a GitHub release asset when ready; the SHA256 file is optional.
To check a downloaded DMG, place both files together and run
`shasum -a 256 -c <filename>.dmg.sha256` from that directory.

This workflow uses the current **ad-hoc, unnotarized development build**. It does
not provide Developer ID signing or notarization; those remain a separate
production-release task. Users drag Universal Remote into Applications after
opening the DMG. Test the installed copy on another Apple silicon Mac before a
public release. The minimum supported system is macOS 27.


## Dependency and output layout

| Path | Contents | Safe to remove routinely? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.dependencies/sources` | Pinned OpenSSL, libssh2 and FreeRDP source checkouts | Re-download required |
| `.dependencies/build` | Reusable native compilation trees | Recompile required |
| `.dependencies/go` | Go modules and build cache | Re-download/recompile required |
| `.dependencies/swift-packages` | Xcode package checkouts/artifacts | Re-download required |
| `.dependencies/test-venv` | Test-only Python environment | Reinstall Paramiko required |
| `.dependencies/rdp-fixture` | Reproducible patched sample-server source/build | Rebuild fixture required |
| `Vendor/Native` | Installed headers, libraries and WireGuard helper | Rebuild native dependencies required |
| `.build` | Disposable app, compiler, icon, release and test outputs | Yes, while builds/tests are stopped |

All generated paths above are Git-ignored. Native libraries remain in `Vendor/Native`; only their source/build caches moved out of `.build`. Command-line Xcode builds explicitly use `.dependencies/swift-packages`. Xcode UI builds use Xcode’s configured package cache; that default cache is outside this repository’s `.build`.

After relocating the checkout, discard `.build`, `.dependencies/build`, `.dependencies/rdp-fixture` and `Vendor/Native`, then rebuild. Native build trees/install prefixes retain absolute paths. Recreate the test venv at its new location; virtual environments are not relocatable. Preserve `.local-testing`. Source checkouts and package/module downloads can remain.

See [testing](testing.md) for repeatable checks and artifact cleanup, [packaging](packaging.md) for signing constraints, and [architecture](architecture.md) for ownership and security decisions.
