# Packaging and signing

Read this before changing bundle assembly, signing, sandbox entitlements or DMG creation.
See [development](development.md) for versioning and release commands.

## Local and distribution identities

Local Debug/Release builds use ad-hoc signing with `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME=NO`.
Never combine ad-hoc signing and hardened runtime: library validation rejects the
bundled ad-hoc dylibs before Swift starts. DYLD can describe a library as missing
when the detailed reason is signature rejection. Verify the actual file and
runtime configuration before diagnosing a missing-library problem.

Distribution requires a real Developer ID identity, hardened runtime, matching
library/helper signatures and notarization. Do not add disable-library-validation
or remove App Sandbox to hide signing errors. Distribution remains pending.

## Repeatable bundle assembly

`bundle-libraries.py` copies the entire native dependency closure to
`Contents/Frameworks`, relocates load paths, and signs every copied library.
The third-party notice directory is replaced before copying, so read-only licenses
from a previous build cannot block updates or leave removed notices behind.

The packaging phase always runs and changes sealed resources. `build.sh` recreates
only the generated Release app before Xcode builds it, ensuring final app signing
runs while preserving compiler/dependency caches. Reusing a sealed app while
replacing dylibs can produce “a sealed resource is missing or invalid”.

## Selected-folder access

The parent retains user-selected read/write access and the app-scoped bookmark
entitlement in `Configuration/UniversalRemote.entitlements`. Persistent RDP folder
exports use these bookmarks; no broad filesystem or Full Disk Access entitlement
is added. Xcode merges this file with generated sandbox/network entitlements.
Final bundle verification checks both selected-file and bookmark rights.
See Apple's [security-scoped access guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional-video-applications/enabling-security-scoped-bookmark-and-url-access).

## Sandboxed WireGuard helper

The child must be signed with exactly App Sandbox and sandbox-inherit entitlements.
The parent needs both incoming and outgoing network rights for UDP reception and
loopback TCP listeners. Unsandboxed command-line fixtures cannot establish packaged
helper startup; use the real signed parent probe. No system VPN, TUN, route or DNS
changes are required.

## Final artifact checks

`verify-bundle.py` checks macOS 27 deployment, arm64-only slices, dependency closure,
relocated paths, signatures/teams, parent network rights and exact child entitlements.
It invokes `--verify-bundle-launch` before UI/storage initialization to exercise DYLD,
and `--verify-wireguard-helper` to start the real embedded helper with synthetic keys
and an owned loopback endpoint, verify a listener and cleanup. Neither reads
SwiftData, Keychain, saved profiles or private input.

`build-dmg.sh` stages the verified app plus an Applications shortcut, creates a
compressed read-only image, verifies the mounted app and ejects that exact volume.
Temporary staging is cleaned on exit; failed detach preserves the staging directory
to avoid deleting a mounted volume. It emits a version/build-named DMG and SHA256
under `.build/releases`, with no commit, tag, upload or publishing operation.

These rules retain the reusable conclusions from earlier launch/resource-seal/helper
incidents. Original crash reports and one-off investigation logs are not repository
assets; inspect any new failure against its own executable and stack.
