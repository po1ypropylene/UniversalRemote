| Component | Pinned release | License | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| FreeRDP / WinPR | 3.32.1 | Apache-2.0 | https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP |
| libssh2 | 1.11.1 | BSD-3-Clause | https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2 |

| SwiftTerm | 1.20.0 | MIT | https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm |

The adjacent files contain upstream license texts. SwiftTerm is resolved through
Swift Package Manager; the others are built from pinned source revisions by
`scripts/prepare-dependencies.sh`. Apple frameworks and the system zlib are
provided by macOS.

FreeRDP includes Google's CPU-feature detection code; its NOTICE and license
are also included below. Test-only Paramiko is not included in the application.

The adjacent license texts and gVisor authors list ship in the app. The compiled
module inventory/checksums are in WireGuard-build-modules.txt; go.mod/go.sum are
the authoritative build pins. The Windows-only wintun module is part of the
upstream module graph but is not compiled or bundled on macOS.

scripts/prepare-wireguard.sh builds a self-contained, arm64/macOS 27 helper with
wireguard-go's existing tun/netstack integration. Its compatible gVisor module
is deliberately pinned by wireguard-go; an arbitrary newer gVisor checkout is
not substituted. The user-provided reference repositories remain unmodified.
Upstreams: https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go and
https://github.com/google/gvisor. Dependency pinning/checksum verification is
not a completed vulnerability or distribution/legal review.
